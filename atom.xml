            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi there!</p>

<p><strong>dev-human</strong> is a project I've been mentally nurturing for about one year now. A couple friends heard me talking about it.
But I could never bring it into reality, until now.</p>

<p>After raving with complex development ideas that would take forever to implement, I just found out that the most important thing
about this project is not code, or anything programming-related. The most important matter for building <em>dev-human</em>
is <strong>content</strong>. And <strong>people</strong> able to create this content.</p>

<p>So today I'm releasing dev-human 's bootstrap. It took me 2 days to build this base using <a href="https://sculpin.io/">Sculpin</a>, a static website generator
from the great <a href="https://twitter.com/beausimensen">Beau Simensen</a>. I like things simple, and I like to focus on content instead of code, from time to time.</p>

<p>I hope some of you will join me, contributing with your ideas - this is not the kind of project that can be built with one mind only.
Do you have an interesting idea to share? A story? A theory? A hobby? Something funny? Something that sounded too off-topic for your
technical blog? Then please, <a href="/contribute">contribute</a>.</p>
